              In an exploration of how machine learning works, I built a neural network from scratch in raw Python. The
              only library used was numpy for some quicker calculations. This was a long project, where I wrote
              everything involved from the ground up. Neurons, layers, activation functions, loss, backpropagation,
              optimizers, testing, training, regression, and so on. The final result is what you see on the right. A
              deep neural network that's able to classify the randomly distributed spiral of red, blue, and green dot
              into their respective colors. I've also used this for predicting the detector response from my optical
              simulation.

            <p class="text-light fs-4 p-lg-2 text-fade hidden">
              Computer graphics are fascinating to me. Games used to mostly reproduce lighting in their scenes through
              rasterization, which focuses on object meshes and shading logic to produce images. These days, some games
              utilize ray tracing. Ray tracing is when the light in the scene is treated as realistically as possible,
              absorbing and bouncing around on every surface. I wrote a ray tracer from scratch to start understanding
              the fundamentals of how modern games use it in their lighting. This ray tracer supports multiple
              materials, bounded volume hierarchy, ray bouncing, motion blur, basic animation, anti-aliasing, and more.
              Eventually, this project will be translated to the Unity game engine, and I'll incorporate the GPU to
              start ray tracing in real-time with parallelization, like modern games do. This also happens to involve
              quite a bit of optical physics, which ties in well with my work on the PROSPECT-II optical simulations.

            <p class="text-light fs-4 p-lg-2 text-fade hidden">
              This one came out of both necessity and pure interest. In writing the paper on Neutrino Directionality, we
              found that there was no clear way to showcase the angles that PROSPECT was reconstructing relative to the
              reactor core. I decided that the best way to approach this was to build a 3D model in Blender and animate
              the camera moving around it. This was a chance to exercise some light artistic creativity as well as
              provide a new look at our detector. The result is what you see on the right, a model complete with
              materials and lighting, while still retaining the most accurate measurements of the detector and reactor
              core that we have.

            <p class="text-light fs-4 p-lg-2 pb-5 text-fade hidden">
              If you can build a competent Chess AI, you can build an AI for any type of game, right? That's my hope, at
              least. I mostly took on this project because the idea of pitting bots against older versions of the AI
              every time I added a new feature sounded really fun. The win rate going up with the inclusion of better
              algorithms and optimization was my main motivation. Then I found out that just getting the program to obey
              all the rules of chess is a much bigger project than I'd imagined. I did get there, however. The AI has
              been tested against official chess AIs like Stockfish to verify its following of the rules. The "AI" just
              plays random moves at the moment, but they are all legal random moves (after painstakingly testing
              millions of positions). The next step when I have time will be incorporating bitboards to boost the depth
              calculation to possibly millions of positions per second.

              It's not like I'm an expert, but I do enjoy building websites. I built this one after all, right?
              Everything here was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap 5. Check out the
              website's responsiveness to different screen sizes by resizing your window horizontally, or open it on
              different devices. Things like the website fading in on load, the text unblurring and fading in from the
              right, the navigation menu hover effects, and the colored layer curves were all made by me. I might end up
              adding more cool features to the website over time, so stay tuned!

              Some features are still experimental, so if you don't see the scrolling fade (for example), use a newer
              version of Chrome or Brave Browser.
