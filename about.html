                        My name's Shashank, and I'm a PhD candidate over at Drexel University. I've wanted to study
                        how
                        the universe works since I was a kid, and I'm finally doing it. My expertise lies with
                        reactor
                        antineutrinos, but all areas of physics interest me (especially particle physics).

                    <p class="fs-3 px-5 text-light">
                        I was born in India, moved to the US when I was 8, and then moved back in high school where I
                        focused on computer science. I went
                        to UMass Amherst for undergrad, majored in Physics, then headed over to Philadelphia to purse my
                        PhD in Physics.

                        My interests with research go beyond simply getting results. Particle physicists
                        often work with large codebases and even larger datasets, so I always emphasize the importance
                        of readable, easily maintained code. It's rare that someone else never ends up reading your
                        code. Not only does this make getting new results faster (because modifications are simple and
                        quick), but it helps other people take your project and expand on it without having to figure
                        out what every line does. Let's be honest, how much time have we all wasted trying to understand
                        someone else's rushed analysis code?

                        Apart from physics, my interests are varied. I like working out and playing basketball. I'm also
                        an advanced pianist. Game development and art has always been something I've explored in my free
                        time. Teaching and education is important to me, so if you're interested in collaborating on
                        outreach together, email me! If you're
                        interested in my work, check out my Professional Projects and my Side Interests! My
                        github is available here.
